### Chapter 1 - Introduction to React Native - (0.5h)

1. What is React & React Native?  

   > **React Native** is a framework that allows you to build **native** mobile apps using **JavaScript**. 
   
2. Why need for React Native?   
  - Learn Once, Write Anywhere - reuse ideas and skills across platforms
  - make mobile dev experience as quick as that of a web developer
  - maintain one codebase instead of two
  - cost of hiring a native developer
  - increase the pool of mobile developers  
  
3. Some misconceptions about React Native  

   > Is it for everybody and every case? NO.  
   
   Read about the [Airbnb experience with React Native](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) and the reasons to move away. Also, have a look at the follow up by [Charlie Cheever](https://blog.expo.io/should-we-use-react-native-1465d8b607ac) from Expo team. 
   
   > Does it mean I don't need to know Java/Swift etc? YES and NO.
